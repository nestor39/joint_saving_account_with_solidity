# Joint Saving Account with Solidity 
I built a smart contract that automates financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I created a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user adresses. These addresses are able to control a joint savings account. This smart contract uses ether management functions to implement the financial requirements necessary for providing the features of a joint savings account. These features consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Technologies
